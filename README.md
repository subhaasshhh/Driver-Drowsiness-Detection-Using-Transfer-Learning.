# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning
The Annihilation Of One’s Life Due To Road Accidents Has Been Increasing Due To Human Fallacy. Various Awareness Programs Have Been Commemorated To Eradicate Portent Possibilities Over Crust But The Graph Stays Exponential. In This Paper, We’ve Tried To Incorporate A Lightweight System For Scrutinizing and Conceding Driver’s Drowsiness State Using Eyes as Our Subject, With Transfer Learning Approach. Here, We Have Subsumed The Mobilenet Model Over MRL Eye Dataset, Stratifying It Into 02 Classes as Open and Closed Eyes. In Our Study, We Achieved An Accuracy Of More Than 97% and Cocksure Our Efficacy For Creating An Insubstantial As Well As An Exemplary Model For Driver Drowsiness Detection.
